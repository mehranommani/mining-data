Prediction Merged Pull Request's Project : 
Is aimed at improving the chances of a closed pull request getting merged into a repository. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the relevant data and identify the parameters that have the greatest influence on the pull request's success rate. By employing three different algorithms, the project can determine the most effective approach to predicting the pull request's chances of getting merged.

Readability Assessment's Project :
Focuses on enhancing the readability of Java code. The project utilizes a variety of tools and libraries to assess the readability of the code, including commit messages, commit hashes, and other relevant features. The project creates two word clouds to compare the readability of the files before and after changes, performs text preprocessing steps such as cleaning, stop-word removal, and potentially stemming, and develops a Random Forest model to predict the changes in readability. Additionally, the project includes a box plot to compare the changes in readability, providing a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of the project's approach.
